# What to do in the plays
#
# These defaults are overridden by whatever controlling script takes
# command - Either a full-fledged shell script such as
# ../../../../dump or ../../../../deploy, or the ventilation flow
# from ../../../../playbooks/push-ventilated.yml. In the former case
# you can override the override using a -e switch on the command
# line.

# ../../../../dump overrides this
play_dump: false

# ../../../../deploy overrides these
play_update: false
play_backup: false

# The ventilation flow overrides this one
play_undump: false

# Both ../../../../deploy and the ventilation flow overrides this one
play_create_or_restore: false

# Note that there are more play_ variables (e.g. in
# ../..//tasks/create-or-restore.yml - you can grep for more), but
# these are always computed (with set_fact or otherwise) so they do
# not need a default value here.
